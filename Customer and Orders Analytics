--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?;

SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE length(orderID) =6
    AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iphone?;

SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE length(orderID) =6
    AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
    AND product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the ordes that were placed in February.;

SELECT cust.acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cust
    JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS FebS
    ON cust.order_id = FebS.orderID
    WHERE length(orderID) =6
    AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
    
#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?;

SELECT product, MIN(price) AS price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan 
    GROUP BY product, price 
    ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;
    
#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?; 

SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    GROUP BY product
    ORDER BY revenue DESC;
